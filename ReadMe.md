## Parallel Computing Matrix Multiply Assignment

#Report

Instructions to run the file.
1. Once inside the directory of the repository run the following command:
'''
python3 matrix.py
'''

2. It will then prompt you the dimensions of the first matrix. Due to the requirement of the mathematical computation to be roughly 10 seconds use the following dimensions for both matrices.
'''
350x350
350x350
'''

3. It will then prompt you the dimensions of the second matrix.

4. Once you input the values for both the matrices it will start to compute the multiplication of the matrices. Once it finishes it will print the result and then mention how long it took for the computation to complete.
